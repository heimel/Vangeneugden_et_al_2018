# Model for Vangeneugden et al. 2018

This folder contains a simulation for the model described in 
Vangeneugden et al. 2018 manuscript "Feedback increases 
surround suppression in awake mouse V1". The simulation is 
written in Matlab and runs in Matlab and Octave.

The main function is feedback_model.m and can be run without 
options to produce some of the figures from the paper. Other 
parameters can be selected from the list in model_parsets.m.

Type 
    help feedback_model
at the Matlab prompt for usage information

The original code for this model can be downloaded from github.com/heimel/vangeneugden_et_al_2018
